# Sudoku Generator Alogorithm
# 1. Generate a full grid of numbers(fully filled in). This step is more complex as it seems as we cannot just randomly generate numbers to 
# fill in the grid. We have to make sure that these numbers are positioned on the grid following the Sudoku rules. To do so will 
# use a sudoku solver algorithm(backtracking algorithm) that we will apply to an empty grid. We will add a random element to this solver 
# algorithm to make sure that a new grid is generated every time we run it. 
# 2. From our full grid, we will then remove 1 value at a time.
# 3. Each time a value is removed we will apply a sudoku solver algorithm to see if the grid can still be solved and to count the number of 
# solutions it leads to. 
# 4. If the resulting grid only has one solution we can carry on the process from step 2. If not we will have to put the value we took away back 
# in the grid.
# 5. We can repeat the same process(from step 2) several times using a different value each time to try to remove additional numbers, resulting in 
# a more difficult grid to solve. The number of attempts we will use to go through this process will have an impact on the difficulty 
# level of the resulting grid.
